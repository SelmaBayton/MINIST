In the field of machine learning, a dataset is a collection of examples or instances that are used to train, validate, and test machine learning models. It consists of input features (also known as predictors or independent variables) and corresponding output labels (also known as targets or dependent variables). Here's a brief mathematical explanation of datasets:

1. Input Features:
Let's denote the input features of a dataset as X, which is an m x n matrix, where m represents the number of examples and n represents the number of features. Each row of the matrix corresponds to a single example, and each column represents a specific feature. The input features can be represented as:

X = [[x_11, x_12, ..., x_1n],
     [x_21, x_22, ..., x_2n],
     ...,
     [x_m1, x_m2, ..., x_mn]]

2. Output Labels:
The output labels of the dataset are denoted as y, which is an m x 1 matrix or vector. It contains the corresponding target values for each example in the dataset. The output labels can be represented as:

y = [[y_1],
     [y_2],
     ...,
     [y_m]]

3. Training, Validation, and Test Sets:
Datasets are typically divided into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate and optimize machine learning models. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and assess model performance, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model's generalization. The division of the dataset can be represented as:

X_train, y_train: Training set
X_val, y_val: Validation set
X_test, y_test: Test set

4. Supervised Learning:
In supervised learning, the dataset includes both input features and corresponding output labels. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the labels given new input features. The relationship between the input features and output labels can be represented as:

y = f(X)

where f() is the unknown mapping function that the machine learning model aims to approximate.

5. Unsupervised Learning:
In unsupervised learning, the dataset contains only input features without any corresponding output labels. The goal is to discover meaningful patterns, structures, or representations within the data. The unsupervised learning task can be represented as:

X = g(X)

where g() represents the unknown transformation or clustering algorithm used to extract information from the input features.

Datasets serve as the foundation for training and evaluating machine learning models. They provide the necessary input and output information for learning algorithms to generalize patterns and make predictions or discover hidden structures in the data. The quality and representativeness of the dataset play a crucial role in the performance and reliability of machine learning models.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from torchvision import datasets
import torch
from skimage.util import montage

def GPU(data):
    return torch.tensor(data, requires_grad=True, dtype=torch.float, device=torch.device('cuda'))

def GPU_data(data):
    return torch.tensor(data, requires_grad=False, dtype=torch.float, device=torch.device('cuda'))

def plot(x):
    if type(x) == torch.Tensor:
        x = x.cpu().detach().numpy()

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    im = ax.imshow(x, cmap='gray')
    ax.axis('off')
    fig.set_size_inches(10, 10)
    plt.show()

def montage_plot(x):
    x = np.pad(x, pad_width=((0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 1)), mode='constant', constant_values=0)
    plot(montage(x))

train_set = datasets.MNIST('./data', train=True, download=True)
test_set = datasets.MNIST('./data', train=False, download=True)

X = train_set.data.numpy()
X_test = test_set.data.numpy()
Y = train_set.targets.numpy()
Y_test = test_set.targets.numpy()

X = X[:, None, :, :] / 255
X_test = X_test[:, None, :, :] / 255

X.shape, Y.shape, X_test.shape, Y_test.shape
X.shape
plot(X[1002, 0, :, :])
Y[1002]
montage_plot(X[0:100, 0, :, :])
```

Explanation:

- The code imports numpy, matplotlib, datasets from torchvision, torch, and montage from skimage.util.
- The `GPU` function is defined to convert data to a tensor with requires_grad=True and move it to the GPU device.
- The `GPU_data` function is defined to convert data to a tensor without requiring gradients and move it to the GPU device.
- The `plot` function is defined to plot an image using matplotlib.
- The `montage_plot` function is defined to create a montage of images and plot it using the `plot` function.
- MNIST datasets (train_set and test_set) are downloaded and stored in the specified directory.
- The data and targets from the MNIST datasets are extracted and stored in variables X, X_test, Y, and Y_test.
- The pixel values in X and X_test are normalized by dividing them by 255.
- The shapes of X, Y, X_test, and Y_test are displayed.
- The shape of X is displayed separately.
- The image at index 1002 in X is plotted using the `plot` function.
- The corresponding target value for the image at index 1002 is displayed.
- A montage of the first 100 images in X is created using the `montage_plot` function.

Please note that the code assumes you have the necessary libraries and modules installed. If any of them are missing, you may encounter errors.
