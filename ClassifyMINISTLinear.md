To classify the MNIST dataset using a linear model, we can employ a simple linear classifier such as logistic regression. Here's a brief mathematical explanation of the classification process:

1. Dataset Representation:
The MNIST dataset consists of images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale matrix, which can be flattened into a 784-dimensional vector. The dataset is represented as a matrix X, where each row corresponds to a flattened image, and a vector y containing the corresponding labels.

2. Model Representation:
For linear classification, we can use logistic regression as a simple linear model. The goal is to learn a set of parameters (weights) that can map the input features to their corresponding classes.

3. Linear Model Equation:
In logistic regression, the linear model computes the weighted sum of the input features (pixels) along with a bias term. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

z = XW + b

where:
- X represents the input matrix of shape (m, n), where m is the number of samples and n is the number of features (784 in the case of MNIST).
- W is the weight matrix of shape (n, k), where k is the number of classes (10 in the case of MNIST).
- b is the bias vector of shape (k,), which accounts for the intercept term.
- z is the resulting matrix of shape (m, k) containing the weighted sum for each sample and class.

4. Softmax Function:
To obtain class probabilities from the weighted sums, we apply the softmax function to normalize the scores. The softmax function converts the raw scores (logits) into a probability distribution over the classes. Mathematically, it is defined as:

softmax(z) = exp(z) / sum(exp(z))

where exp(z) calculates the element-wise exponential of z, and the sum of the exponential values ensures that the resulting probabilities sum up to 1.

5. Predicted Class:
The predicted class for each sample is determined by selecting the class with the highest probability. It can be obtained using:

predicted_class = argmax(softmax(z))

where argmax returns the index of the maximum value along a given axis.

6. Model Training:
To train the linear classifier, we utilize a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the predicted class probabilities and the true labels. One common choice is the cross-entropy loss, given by:

loss = -sum(y * log(softmax(z)))

where y is the one-hot encoded vector representing the true labels.

7. Optimization:
The goal of optimization is to find the optimal values for the weight matrix W and the bias vector b that minimize the loss function. This is typically done using gradient-based optimization algorithms such as gradient descent or its variants. The gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters are computed, and the parameters are updated iteratively to minimize the loss.

By iteratively adjusting the weights and biases using the training data, the linear model learns to classify the MNIST images into their respective digit classes.
