Convolution is a fundamental operation used in various machine learning algorithms, especially in the field of computer vision. It is commonly employed in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tasks such as image recognition and feature extraction. Here's a brief mathematical explanation of convolution:

1. Operation Definition:
Convolution is an operation that combines two functions to produce a third function. In the context of machine learning, it involves applying a filter (also called a kernel) to an input signal or image to obtain a transformed output.

2. Notation:
- Input Signal/Image: A matrix or tensor represented as X.
- Filter/Kernel: A smaller matrix or tensor represented as K.
- Output: The result of applying the convolution operation, denoted as C.

3. Convolution Formula:
The convolution operation is defined as the element-wise multiplication of the filter with a specific region of the input, followed by summing the products. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

C(i, j) = sum(sum(X(m, n) * K(i-m, j-n)))

where:
- C(i, j) represents the value at position (i, j) in the output.
- X(m, n) denotes the value at position (m, n) in the input.
- K(i-m, j-n) refers to the value in the filter at the relative position (i-m, j-n).

4. Convolution Operation Steps:
The convolution operation is performed by sliding the filter over the input, computing the element-wise multiplications and the sum for each position. The steps involved are as follows:

- Step 1: Place the filter at the top-left corner of the input.
- Step 2: Perform element-wise multiplication between the filter and the corresponding region of the input.
- Step 3: Sum the results of the element-wise multiplications to obtain a single value for the output.
- Step 4: Slide the filter to the next position (typically by one or more pixels) and repeat steps 2 and 3.
- Step 5: Continue sliding the filter until the entire input has been covered, generating the full output.

The size of the output depends on factors such as the size of the input, the size of the filter, and the stride (i.e., the amount by which the filter is shifted at each step).

Convolution plays a crucial role in CNNs by enabling the extraction of local features from the input data. It helps capture patterns, edges, and other relevant information, leading to effective representation learning and improved performance in various machine learning tasks.

```python
%%capture
!pip install git+https://github.com/williamedwardhahn/mpcr
from mpcr import *
import imageio as io

# Load image from URL
image = io.imread("http://harborparkgarage.com/img/venues/pix/aquarium2.jpg")

# Display the image
plot(image)

# Normalize the image
image = image.astype(float) / 255.0

image.shape

# Create a random 5x5x3 array
plot(np.random.random((5, 5, 3)))

# Create random filters
filters = np.random.random((96, 11, 11, 3))

# Display a filter
plot(filters[1, :, :, :])
```

Explanation:
- The `%%capture` magic command is used to capture the output of the pip install command.
- The code installs the `mpcr` library from a GitHub repository using the `pip install` command.
- The `imageio` library is imported as `io`.
- The code loads an image from the given URL using the `io.imread` function.
- The loaded image is displayed using the `plot` function.
- The image is normalized by dividing it by 255.0 to bring the pixel values within the range of [0, 1].
- The shape of the image is printed using the `shape` attribute.
- A random 5x5x3 array is created using the `np.random.random` function, representing an RGB image.
- The random array is displayed using the `plot` function.
- Random filters are created with dimensions (96, 11, 11, 3), representing a set of 96 filters with size 11x11x3.
- A filter from the filters array is displayed using the `plot` function.
