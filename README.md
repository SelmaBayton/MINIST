# MINIST
MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a large collection of handwritten digits that are commonly used for training and testing image classification algorithms

##
1. Gradient: The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest ascent of a function. In machine learning, gradients are used in optimization algorithms like gradient descent to update the model's parameters during training, with the goal of minimizing the loss function.

2. Vectorization: Vectorization is the process of expressing operations on entire arrays or matrices rather than individual elements. It leverages the parallelism capabilities of modern CPUs and GPUs, resulting in faster and more efficient computations in machine learning algorithms.

3. Scaling: Scaling refers to the process of normalizing or standardizing the feature values in a dataset. It ensures that features are on a similar scale, which is important for many machine learning algorithms. Common scaling techniques include normalization (scaling values between 0 and 1) and standardization (scaling values to have zero mean and unit variance).

4. Coordinate: In the context of machine learning, coordinates typically refer to the individual components of a feature vector or data point. For example, in a 2-dimensional space, coordinates represent the X and Y values that define the position of a point.

5. Autoencoder: An autoencoder is a type of neural network architecture used for unsupervised learning. It consists of an encoder network that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional latent space representation, and a decoder network that reconstructs the original input from the latent representation. Autoencoders are commonly used for dimensionality reduction and feature learning.

6. Convolution: Convolution is a mathematical operation that combines two functions to produce a third function. In machine learning, convolutional operations are commonly used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from input data, such as images or sequences. Convolutional layers apply filters to the input data, capturing local patterns and spatial relationships.

7. Optimization: Optimization refers to the process of finding the best set of parameters or configuration for a machine learning model that minimizes a predefined objective function (e.g., loss function). Optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, are used to iteratively update the model's parameters to improve its performance.

8. Random Walk: A random walk is a mathematical concept where an object moves randomly from one position to another in a sequence of steps. In machine learning, random walks can be used in various contexts, such as generating synthetic data or exploring the state space in reinforcement learning.

9. Slicing and Indexing: Slicing and indexing are operations used to access specific elements or subsets of data in arrays or data structures. In machine learning, slicing and indexing are commonly used to extract features or target variables from datasets, or to access specific portions of arrays for computations.
